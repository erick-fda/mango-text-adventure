MangoText is a text adventure game that uses a GUI for input, rather than taking text 
input. The project was started in February 2018. MangoText is heavily inspired by the 
text adventure games created by Fenoxo, such as _Corruption of Champions_ and 
_Trials in Tainted Space_.

MangoText is built on the Unity engine.
